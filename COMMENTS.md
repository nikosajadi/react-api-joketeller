 # Oneflow - Frontend Assignment# 
 # Tools and Libraries Used
  In this file, I will detail the steps and decisions I made throughout the implementation of the task.
Steps Taken:

**1**-Added the necessary files and configuration: I created a file named `COMMENTS.md` to document the steps and decisions during the task implementation.
**2**-Installed the core React libraries: I used Yarn as my package manager to install the necessary React libraries.

I decided to use the Fetch API for fetching data from the API endpoint rather than other methods such as XMLHttpRequest or Axios. My reasoning is as follows:

I have experience using Axios in different projects, and I recognize that it is a highly professional and feature-rich library. However, for this particular project and after conducting some research (for instance, [on this website](https://builtin.com/software-engineering-perspectives/react-api)), 
* I believe that using the Fetch API is more appropriate.

Fetch API provides a simple and modern way to make API requests, which aligns well with the minimal requirements of this project.
Axios offers additional features, but considering the scope of this project, it seemed unnecessary to add another library when Fetch API is sufficient.
XMLHttpRequest is an older method, and Fetch API offers better functionality for modern JavaScript applications.
In my opinion, the Fetch API is a more suitable choice for this project, allowing for clean and efficient API requests while keeping the codebase lightweight.
